### Theme
This blog uses a slighlty modified version of [Athena](https://github.com/broccolini/athena), a simple and elegant theme for Jekyll and GitHub Pages by [Diana Mounter](http://broccolini.net). Modifications are mainly to be found in `â€”layouts`and `_includes` and consist in small tweaks to display images in the index and categories pages, and allow for responsive video. 

### License
The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
