<h2><a href="https://film-Storyboards.com/">FILM STORYBOARDS</a></h2>
<br/><hr><p>Storyboarding is a unique yet simple way to see the whole picture of a project at once. You can use a Storyboards as a visual screenplay, at the writing stage of a film. You can use it to edit before filming: test how a story works in images, organise its sequences rhythm and flow. Storyboards are useful to plan, assess costs and ease communication between production crew members.</p>

<p>This blog will feature Storyboards, obviously, work in process, Sketches, doodles and pre production drawings as well as the occasional filmmaking references and links.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
