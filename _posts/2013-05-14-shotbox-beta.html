<p>After reading an article about the Swedish startup <a href="http://www.shotbox.se" title="Shotbox">Shotbox</a> and their cloud based  <a href="http://www.arcticstartup.com/2013/05/07/shotbox-beta" title="the future of Storyboardsing">storyboarding tool</a>, I decided to test it with a really rough Storyboards.</p>

<p>So far it’s a very convincing tool: intuitive, simple, and fast.</p>

<p>You can break down your script in Storyboards with notes, with various neat preview options and export and share it in various format.</p>

<p>You can edit your text in <em>Markdown</em> and even change the styling of your Storyboards, see the <a href="http://shotboxab.tumblr.com/post/48607441130/pro-tips" title="Shotbox Pro Tips">pro tips</a>, here.</p>

<p>The only thing I found missing would be the ability to crop and reframe images, something I usually do in InDesign, but this might be in the works. This would be really helpful for Storyboards artists used to draw their shots larger to enable later composition changes. Then, but it’s a bigger step, the ability to draw within the online canvas itself would be cool.</p>

<p>Something that filmmakers, games and advertising companies will certainly watch in the future.</p>
