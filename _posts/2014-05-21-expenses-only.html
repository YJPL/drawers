<p>Received this yesterday. You would be surprised how many similar requests I receive on a yearly basis:

<i><b>We are looking for an assistant art director to possibly start today until (&hellip;) (to help) with graphics and some prop sourcing and a standby art director (&hellip;). This is though an expenses only job.</b></i>

This was my reply (I reply to every single request):</p>

<p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/de731699077b84a02b89c16b7f2ee1c6/picture_inline_n5xmgf3L9p1rvl0qp.png"/></p><p>The problem here is not so much that people are willing to work for free to see an &ldquo;amazing script&rdquo; come to life. The script and the people involved may be great. The problem is that it is almost considered a standard practice with creative work.  Many designers and illustrators have been accepting these conditions for ages, too, which doesn&rsquo;t help the case.

Listen, I get it: you are under pressure to find a job. Fair enough, you may be anxious to break into the industry. But I&rsquo;m also pretty sure things won&rsquo;t work well for you if you accept these kinds of jobs.  It is unlikely that any self respecting skilled person will work at their peak on this basis for long. Outside of the director&rsquo;s circle of friends.

I just wish there would be more solidarity within the industry. If a project is great it will seldom go unnoticed. And letâ€™s not forget that today, an artist has some legit crowd funding options at disposal.

All right, let&rsquo;s add this in the &ldquo;unpaid creative jobs is normal&rdquo; folder&hellip;</p>
