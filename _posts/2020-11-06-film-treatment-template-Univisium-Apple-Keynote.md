Film directors and producers like to use this paginated film treatment and storyboard theme for [Apple Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/), perfect to pitch **2.00:1** aspect ratio films. (Univisium is cinematographer Vittorio Storaro format). With over sixty master slides, this theme is ready for print and screen use. This theme has a set of different title pages, intro pages, treatment pages, many options for treatment and storyboards layout, a light and a dark mode, and an icon master.

To create your storyboard, first, add a new slide—in the left area navigator (**Add Slide**). 
You can change your slide layout (**Format** > **Change Master** button) in the right navigation panel (**View** > **Inspector** > **Format**).

Then chose your layout in the left navigator. Whether you use text or not, page, scenes, and shot numbers. You can use the rule of thirds guides to help you reframe your shots (**View** > **Guides** & **Hide Guides**). To make consistent changes to your layout, use the **Edit Master Slide** button in the right navigation panel.

You will find *[vector arrows](https://templates.supply/templates/free-vector-storyboard-arrows-adobe-illustrator/)* located in the last master slide. Copy and paste icons from that **Master Slide** into your document. Use them to show camera moves, movement within the shot, and the character’s eyes direction.

This template is in English, with body text in Avenir Light 10 points with 1.2 spacing. You will find a lot of different typographic styles for your copy in the **Format** panel.

This theme makes it easy and fast to put your film treatment and storyboard together in a clean presentation.
