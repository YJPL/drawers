### ‚ù§Ô∏è Membership üëâ
[Membership](https://gum.co/all-access) lets you access all paid templates at once and includes the new templates published within the next year and free updates to all the templates for one year.

Right now, this means **50** filmmaking templates for [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html) (Mac and PC), [Apple Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/), and [Apple Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/). You get all the storyboard layouts and the film treatment templates, all at once.

This membership is for one year. The base price represents over **$300** in saving if you wanted to buy all the templates individually.

If you work in film production, animation, or TV commercials under tight deadlines, those ready to use layouts for storyboard presentations and film treatments will save you a lot of time and headaches.

To get an overview of the existing templates, check [https://storyboards.gumroad.com](https://storyboards.gumroad.com).

In addition, there are currently **29** free templates that are also part of this membership, for convenience, at no additional cost. You can pick the *Free templates membership* tier alone or get both.
