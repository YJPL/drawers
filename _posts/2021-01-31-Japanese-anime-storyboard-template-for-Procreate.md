## Free Procreate storyboard template for 1.85:1 aspect ratio anime films
Story artists, animators, film directors, illustrators, and designers love this free anime storyboard template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, initially designed for print and now available for [Procreate](https://procreate.art). This template has five frames per sheet, 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen). The beautiful storyboards from *Studio Ghibli* inspired this layout.


- The first column indicates **cuts**. Use it to number your shots—a single shot sometimes need several pictures.
- The second column is the **picture** screen. That’s where you draw your storyboard shots.
- Then there is a space for **action**, **dialogue**, and your script notes.
- The last column, **time**, is for writing the duration of your shots in seconds.
