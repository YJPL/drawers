## InDesign storyboard template for 16:9 (1.77:1) aspect ratio, five frames per page, Avenir Book on A4 Vertical with boxes.

This is a seven pages storyboard template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page for 16:9 (1.77:1) aspect ratio storyboards, with five frames per sheet. You can either edit this storyboard template with Adobe InDesign or print the blank one to draw on paper.
**Boxes:**
- The first column indicates the number of your cuts.
- The second column stands for the picture screen, where you draw or place your storyboard shots.
-  Last, there is a split column for your script notes: action and dialogue.

Only duplicate the page you want to use. To import your drawings, place your pictures into the frames that belong to the **Images** layer. Resize as you see fit. You can use the ***Rule of Thirds*** guides located in the top locked layer to help you frame your compositions. Use the **Text** layer for your notes. To format your body text, look for **Paragraph Styles** under **Type** and **Character Styles** under **Type** for shot numbers. Change the template to make it your own. Fill in the header, add your credits and project details, put your production title or logo. And your presentation is now ready for print or screens in no time! 

IDML (InDesign Markup) format is compatible with all InDesign versions from CS4 to the current CC2021. 

**FYI:** Since the document grid corresponds to the 16:9 aspect ratio, you can build variations with ease. The smallest module is 21,333 by 12 points. Its height matches the document body text’s leading—9 points is recommended for body text. You need the font Avenir installed on your machine for this template to work as planned. 

Use the **A-Pagination** master for pagination, the **A-Master** for a clean sheet. You will also find masters and formatting for dark mode under **Pages**.
You can hide the baseline grid and the document grid for clarity (**View** > **Grids & Guides** > **Show Baseline Grid** & **Hide Baseline Grid**). 

This template will save you time and help you present your storyboards!
