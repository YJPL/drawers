## Free Procreate anime storyboard template for 2.00:1 (Univisium) films
Story artists, animators, film directors, illustrators, and designers love this free anime storyboard template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, initially designed for print and now available for [Procreate](https://procreate.art). This template has five frames per sheet, all 2.00:1 aspect ratio ([Univisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univisium)). The fantastic storyboards from Studio Ghibli inspired this layout.

**Boxes**

- The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots—a single shot sometimes need several pictures.
- The second column is the picture screen. That’s where you draw your storyboard shots.
- Then there is a space for action, dialogue, and your script notes.
- The last column, time, is for writing the duration of your shots in seconds.
