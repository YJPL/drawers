## Free Procreate anime storyboard template for 2.00:1 (Univisium) films (Jp version)
Story artists, animators, film directors, illustrators, and designers love this free anime storyboard template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, initially designed for print and now available for [Procreate](https://procreate.art). This template has five frames per sheet, 2.00:1 aspect ratio ([Univisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univisium)). The beautiful storyboards from *Studio Ghibli* were the inspiration for this layout.

**Boxes:**

- The first column, **カット**, indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.
- The second column, **画面**, stands for the picture screen, where you draw or place your storyboard shots.
- **内容** stands for content, use this space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)
- The last column, **秒**, is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.
