This is a free advertising storyboard template layout for 1.85:1 films, that you can edit with [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html). IDML (InDesign Markup) is compatible with all Adobe InDesign versions from CS4 to CC 2021.  

This template is designed to showcase storyboards for TV commercials, institutional movies and ideal for agency pitches.

This template has 19 DIN A4 horizontal (landscape) numbered pages. It gives you different layout and framing options. You can number and name your shots and write treatment notes alongside your pictures.  The template includes character styles and a color scheme.

To get started, only duplicate the spreads or page you want to use. Remove unused sheets. Then all you have to do is change the **Text** and **Images** layers. Fill the opening page with your project details. The body text font is Avenir Book, 10 points with 12 points leading. Drop your pictures into the **Images** layer. Use the *Rule of thirds* guides to help you reframe your compositions.  

To change or remove pagination and the footnote, use the **A-Master** located in layers. Use the **B-Master** for dark mode. Add a logo, complete the credits page and so on. Your presentation is then ready to export for print or screen. 

You can get free vector arrows icons to indicate camera moves here: [https://gum.co/storyboard-arrows](https://gum.co/storyboard-arrows).

Note that you need the Avenir Next typeface license to use this template. 

This template is a timesaver that will help you design and present beautiful storyboards.
