Free [Procreate](https://procreate.art) storyboard template on DIN A4 horizontal (landscape) page for story artists, animators, film directors, illustrators, and designers. This template has an unusual 9:16 (1: 1.77) aspect ratio, with ten frames per sheet. The original storyboard design mimics a phone screen in scroll mode to present a web miniseries. 

There are layers for editing text and a *rule of thirds* layer to help you reframe your shots.
