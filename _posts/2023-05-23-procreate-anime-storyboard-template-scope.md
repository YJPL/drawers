Story artists, animators, film directors, illustrators, and designers love this free anime storyboard template on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, initially designed for print and now available for [Procreate](https://procreate.com). This template has five frames per sheet, in 2.39:1 aspect ratio (Scope). The fantastic storyboards from *Studio Ghibli* were the inspiration for this layout.

**Boxes:**

- The first column indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.

- The second column is the picture screen, where you draw or place your storyboard shots.

- Then there is a space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)

- The last column, time, is for writing the duration of your shots in seconds.
